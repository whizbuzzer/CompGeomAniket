# Implementation of Computational Geometry Algorithms with C++
This project is created for the purpose of learning how to create and implement Computational Geometry algorithms in C++

Creating this project exposed me to the implementation of template classes/methods, OOP implementation in C++, pointers, header file creation, unit testing and other concepts crucial to building robust projects in C++ as well as good practices to follow while creating C++ projects.

Please go through Notes.md as it has important stuff pertaining to this project
