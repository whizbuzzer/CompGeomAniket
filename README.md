# Implementation of Computational Geometry Algorithms with C++
This repository is created BY refering to the course, [Mastering Computational Geometry Algorithms with C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-computational-geometry-cpp/)

Creating this repo exposed me to the implementation of template classes/methods, OOP implementation in C++, pointers, header file creation, unit testing and other concepts crucial to building robust projects in C++ as well as good practices to follow while creating C++ projects.
