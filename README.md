# Implementation of Computational Geometry Algorithms with C++
This project is created BY refering to the course, [Mastering Computational Geometry Algorithms with C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-computational-geometry-cpp/) for the purpose of learning how to create and implement Computational Geometry algorithms

Creating this project exposed me to the implementation of template classes/methods, OOP implementation in C++, pointers, header file creation, unit testing and other concepts crucial to building robust projects in C++ as well as good practices to follow while creating C++ projects.

Please go through Notes.md as it has important stuff pertaining to this project
