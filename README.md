# Implementation of Computational Geometry Algorithms with C++
This project is created for the purpose of learning how to create and implement Computational Geometry algorithms in C++

Creating this project has exposed me to various C++ concept implementations such as

1. template classes/methods
2. OOP implementation in C++, pointers
3. header file creation
4. unit testing
5. other concepts crucial to building robust projects in C++
6. good practices to follow while creating C++ projects.

Please go through Notes.md as it has important stuff pertaining to this project
